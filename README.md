## Intro

Experiment with your songwriting approach.  Draw inspiration from a scramble.  This script allows you to mash up existing song lyrics and see new word combinations.  It takes one or more plain text files (of song lyrics) and shuffles all the containing words, giving you a rich collage.  How else will you get strange lines like "dice me magic" or "nothing to sucker for?"

## Usage

Clone the repo and cd in.  Run the install script to get lyric-shuffler in your path -

    ./install.sh

Then pass the program some plain text files full of rich words - 

    lyric-shuffler some-bitchin-lyrics.txt some-more-lyrics.txt you-get-the-idea.txt

You'll see the new output stream by on the console.  You can run it again and again with the same text files and the output will differ each time.  Write to a new file like this -

    lyric-shuffler some-lyrics.txt some-more-lyrics.txt you-get-the-idea.txt > mashed_up_lyrics_output.txt

- or just copy and paste.
