Usage
=======

Clone the repo and cd in.  The run.py script takes path to dir of songs.  Song files should be plain text with 'txt' extension.  Run like this -

    ./run.py /path/to/dir/of/songs/

It will shuffle up the given text files and print to stdout. You can write to new file like this -

    ./__main__.py > mashed_up_lyrics_output.txt
